# Salary vs Experience Analysis (Excel)

## Business Question
How does salary change with years of experience?

## Dataset
This project uses a salary dataset sourced from Kaggle containing two variables:
- Years of Experience
- Salary

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Analysis Approach
- Created a scatter plot to examine the relationship between years of experience and salary
- Grouped years of experience into four levels: Entry, Mid, Senior, and Advanced
- Calculated average salary for each experience level using Excel formulas

## Key Insight
Average salary increases consistently with experience level, with the most noticeable increase occurring between Mid and Senior levels.

## Limitations
The dataset does not include additional factors such as job role, location, or company size, which may also influence salary.
